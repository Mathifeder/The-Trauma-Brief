Hi! I’m Marito Funez, and this is *The Trauma Brief* a student-run newsletter all about **trauma and emergency medicine**. I started it to learn more about how doctors and first responders handle emergencies and to share what I’m learning with other students.

## Latest Issues
- Coming Soon!  

## Mission
The goal of this newsletter is to make trauma and emergency medicine easier for students to understand. I want to explain things clearly, show how they apply in real-life emergencies, and include facts and research when I can.  

Basically, it’s a place to explore medicine, learn, and think about what it’s like to help people in high-stakes situations.
