# About Me

My name is Marito Funez, and I’m a high school student interested in trauma care and emergency medicine. I’m fascinated by how healthcare professionals make fast, high-stakes decisions and how small actions can make a big difference in critical situations.

I started *Trauma Brief* as a way to learn more about emergency and trauma medicine while sharing what I learn along the way. Each issue focuses on a specific topic, case, or concept related to trauma care, prehospital medicine, or emergency response. The goal is to keep things short, clear, and useful—especially for students who are curious about this field.

This newsletter is part of my journey toward a future in healthcare and a way for me to build better habits in learning, writing, and thinking critically about medicine.
