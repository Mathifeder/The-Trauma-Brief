# The Trauma Brief

The Trauma Brief is a student-run medical newsletter focused on trauma care and emergency medicine. It’s a personal learning project where I explore topics related to emergencies, critical care, and how healthcare professionals respond in high-pressure situations.

This project is meant to help me learn more about medicine while also sharing clear, easy-to-understand explanations with other students who are interested in this field.

## About the Project

Each issue of *The Trauma Brief* is written to:
- Break down trauma and emergency medicine topics in a way students can understand
- Connect medical concepts to real-life emergency situations
- Help students get early exposure to healthcare, emergency response, and preparedness
