# Issue #1 - The Bystander Effect

The bystander effect an be defined as a social theory that the more people witnessing a person in distress, the less likely you are to help them. [^1][^2][^3][^4] Allow me to paint an example, a person is injured on the ground, pleading for help in the bustling streets of New York City with about 100 people walking in the street. People are late to work, running ahead, children crying as their mothers attempt to quiet them down. The normal thought process of a person is "Oh well, someone else will help them, so I won't". This spreads the responsibility to the crowd around you & makes you feel less responsibility to go & help.

SoulPancake's youtube video[^1] on this  really illustrates the bystander effect via the setup of a tent ranging in groups of 10 people to a single person. I have made a graph with his results below:

| Number of People | Average Time until help offered |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| 10 People | 8 Minutes & 1 Second |
| 5 People | 7 Minutes & 25 Seconds |
| Single Person | 3 Minutes & 19 Seconds |

With the results given in the video, I belive that they speak for themselves & clearly highlights how the bystander effect affects people who want to help but doesn't feel pressure to.
